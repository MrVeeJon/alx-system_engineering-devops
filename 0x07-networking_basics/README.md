The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer in the OSI model performs specific tasks, and these layers work together to enable communication between devices on a network. Here's a simple breakdown of the seven layers:

Physical Layer:

Focus: Deals with the physical connection between devices.
Example: Cables, connectors, and the transmission of raw binary data (0s and 1s) over the network.

Data Link Layer:

Focus: Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes.
Example: Ethernet frames that include MAC addresses for device identification.

Network Layer:

Focus: Manages the addressing, routing, and forwarding of data between devices on different networks.
Example: IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and routers.

Transport Layer:

Focus: Ensures end-to-end communication, including error recovery and flow control.
Example: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, connection-oriented communication.

Session Layer:

Focus: Manages sessions or connections between applications on different devices.
Example: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

Presentation Layer:

Focus: Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers, handling data formatting and encryption.
Example: Data compression, encryption, and character set conversion.

Application Layer:

Focus: Provides a network interface for user applications.
Example: Protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP that allow applications to communicate over the network.
