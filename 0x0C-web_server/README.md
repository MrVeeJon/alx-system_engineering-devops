0x0C. Web server

A web server is a software application or hardware device responsible for handling incoming requests from clients (typically web browsers) and serving them with the requested web pages or resources. The primary role of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web content to users over the Internet. It receives requests, interprets them, retrieves the requested data, and sends it back to the client.


A child process is a spawned instance of a program that is created by another process, known as the parent process. In the context of web servers, the child processes are spawned to handle incoming client requests. Each child process operates independently, allowing the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously. This is known as a multiprocessing or multitasking approach, and it helps in improving the server's performance by distributing the workload among multiple processes. Web servers often use a parent-child process model for scalability and performance reasons. The parent process is responsible for managing and overseeing the child processes. When a request comes in, the parent process can delegate the handling of that request to one of the available child processes. This approach enables the server to handle multiple requests concurrently without being blocked by one time-consuming task. If a child process crashes or encounters issues, it typically doesn't affect the overall stability of the web server, as the other child processes continue to operate independently.
