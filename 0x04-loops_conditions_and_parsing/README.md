The objectives of this project is to know:
How to create SSH keys
What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
How to use while, until and for loops
How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
How to use the cut command
What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

Loops:
for loop:
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.) or other iterable objects.

while loop:
The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Conditions:
if, elif, else statements:
Conditions are used to make decisions in your code.

Parsing:
Input from the user:
You can use the input() function to get input from the user.

Parsing strings to other types:
You may need to convert strings to other types, like integers or floats.
