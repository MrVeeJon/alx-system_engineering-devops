The objectives of this project is to make me know:
What is a PID
What is a process
How to find a processâ€™ PID
How to kill a process
What is a signal
What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored


Processes:
A process is an independent program that runs in its own space and has its own memory. You can create and manage processes in Python using the multiprocessing module.

Signals
Signals are software interrupts that notify a process that a specific event has occurred. Python provides the signal module for working with signals.
