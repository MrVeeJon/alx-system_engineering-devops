Objectives of this project is to make me know:

What is localhost/127.0.0.1
What is 0.0.0.0
What is /etc/hosts
How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces

Localhost refers to the current device or computer that you are working on. It is often used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface.

0.0.0.0 is a place holder for "no specific address," a non-routable meta-address that is used to indicate an invalid, unidentified, or non-applicable target.
